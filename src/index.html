          StoriED is a literacy initiative fiscally sponsored through New Sun
          Rising that is actively working to amplify the humanistic stories of
          diverse educators and improve literacy outcomes while addressing the
          social emotional learning needs of students in grades K-5 through a
          preservice teacher literacy fellowship housed at The University of
          Pittsburgh, providing one-to-one tutoring and Cultural Literacy
          Saturdays. Our work is grounded in Gholdy Muhammad's Culturally
          Responsive Pillars of identity, criticality, intellect, skills and
          joy.
